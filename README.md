OMG dude, I just finished 𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩𝘪𝘯𝘨 Novocaine and my brain's still buzzing. Like, seriously, how did that   get so weird so fast? Steve Martin, bro. I mean, when did he become this chaotic dentist dude? One minute it's all chill, he's doing dental stuff, right, and then bam, he’s in the middle of this wild crime noir thing? Honestly didn't expect that.

You know how sometimes you just sit there like, “wait, what?” That was me the whole time. And Helena Bonham Carter, holy crap, she's got this vibe where you’re like, is she dangerous or just eccentric? But then again, with her, it's kinda always both, you feel me? I was thinking about it and couldn't remember where I'd seen her, then realized, duh, Fight Club. Anyway, side note, if you haven't seen it in ages, 𝘥𝘰𝘸𝘯𝘭𝘰𝘢𝘥 the   or something. Might blow your mind all over again.

> But dude, the way things just piled up, like it’s just one bad choice after another, and you’re sitting there shouting at the screen like, “NOOO, that’s not what you’re supposed to do!” It’s like a series of unfortunate events, but without the cute kids. LOL.

Random thought, do dentists actually keep laughing gas that easily accessible? Can’t say I’ve ever seen my dentist pull out a tank and start sucking it up like a Popsicle, y'know? Prob should’ve Googled that before 𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩𝘪𝘯𝘨 the  . 😂 But whatever, it’s a  .

Oh, and the part where they tried to pin a crime on him, what even is going on? I love how these  s make you question everything. Real-life isn’t like that, is it? Or maybe it is and I just need to get out more... eek! And absinthe? Do people still drink that? Or was that just Hollywood trying to sprinkle some edgy mystique over everything?

Actually, speaking of 𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩𝘪𝘯𝘨 stuff, do you remember that time we tried to have a   marathon and fell asleep like halfway through? Good times, man. Anyway, 𝘥𝘰𝘸𝘯𝘭𝘰𝘢𝘥 the   or we’ll make a plan and actually 𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩 the   together next time.

int i = 0; // no idea why I'm typing this, just popped in my head lol

But yeah, that’s pretty much where my head’s at right now. How’s everything with you?
